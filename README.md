# Simple real-time chat web application using Ruby on Rails and React.js Starter Project

This is a starter project that combines a Ruby on Rails backend with a React.js frontend. This setup is ideal for building modern web applications with a clear separation between frontend and backend. It demonstrates how to build a real-time chat application using React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails 7 for the backend, with WebSockets enabling live communication.

**Key Components**

  **1. React Frontend**: React is used to build the user interface, handling the rendering of messages, chat input, and user interactions in real-time.

  **2. Ruby on Rails 7 Backend**: Rails 7 comes with built-in support for WebSockets via Action Cable, which allows real-time, bi-directional communication between the server and the client. Action Cable is   responsible for managing WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages, and ensuring communication between clients happens instantly.

  **3. WebSockets**: WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling live data streaming between the client and the server without frequent HTTP requests. This makes it ideal for chat applications, where messages are transmitted instantly as users send them.

  **4. Action Cable**: This is a framework that integrates WebSocket connections into Rails, allowing Rails to handle multiple real-time connections. It enables chat messages to be broadcast in real time to all connected users.

**Basic Flow**
- When a user sends a message, the message is transmitted to the server using WebSockets.
- The server, using Action Cable, broadcasts the message to all subscribed clients.
- React listens for these messages and updates the chat interface instantly without page reloads.

## Implementation Steps
**Frontend Setup**:
  - **Technology**: React
  - **Styling**: Use a CSS.
  - **Real-Time Communication**: Implement WebSocket to handle real-time updates.
**Backend Setup**:
  - **Technology**: Node.js 
  - **WebSocket Server**: Use libraries like ws for a WebSocket server to handle real-time messaging.

**Frontend Implementation**
**Components**:
  - **Chat Window**: Displays messages and handles user input.
  - **Message List**: Shows the list of messages in the chatroom.
  - **Input Field**: Allows users to type and send messages.
**State Management**: Use Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks to manage and display messages.

**UI/UX Design**
- Ensure the chat window is scrollable and handles different message types gracefully.
- Use modern design principles to keep the UI clean and user-friendly.
- Implement responsive design to ensure usability on various devices.

This combination of React, Rails 7, WebSockets, and Action Cable is commonly used to build efficient, modern real-time applications, particularly chat systems.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Ruby** (version 3.3.3)
- **Rails** (version 7.2.1)
- **Node.js** (version 20.12.0)
